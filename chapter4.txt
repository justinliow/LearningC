Malloc, heap and time
1. static 
2. free

Heap allocation gotchas
1. all the heap memory is used up
2. ctime() provides a human readable version. 
3. the same location is being freed twice. By the second time it has already been freed. 
4. you cannot print out where the pointer leads if it has been freed.
5. dont try to do something to pointers that have already been freed.
